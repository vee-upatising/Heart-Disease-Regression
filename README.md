# Regression
Exploring Regression with Regression Trees, K Nearest Neighbor, Ridge, and Lasso using K-Fold Cross Validation

# Data
The goal of this project is to find a mapping of these features to risk in heart disease

This dataset was provided by researchers at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

# Model Selection
I used K-Fold Cross Validation to perform model selection
